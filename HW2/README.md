# HW 2

### Contributions
Homework was completed entirely by Willow Fortino.

### What was this homework about?
In this homework there were two parts. The first was a few exercises about the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution and how it is simply a special case of the chi distribution for three degrees of freedom. We explored empiricaly and analyticaly calculating the mean of a distribution. As we discussed in class, the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution is important in the history of statistics because it represents the first time humanity was able to relate the macrostate of a system to the statistics of the microstates of the system.

In the second part of the homework, we explored the law of large numbers and the central limit thorem by sampling five different disitributions and showing two things: 1) how the mean of a large sample of a distribution will likely be closer to the mean of the distribution than the mean of a small sample. 2) the distribution of means of samples from distributions will tend toward a normal distribution. These two things are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem, respectively.

### What was the <b>hardest</b> part of this homework for you?
The main for-loop for making Figure 1 took some time as there is a lot of room for mistakes.

### What was the <b>easiest</b> part of this homework for you?
The gaussian curve fitting was very easy for me as I have a lot of experience with curve fitting in python.

### What is one new think you learned?
I finally understand how scipy.stats is organized. I better know how to use the rvs, pdf, cdf, etc. methods.
