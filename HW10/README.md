# HW 10

### Contributions
Homework was completed entirely by Willow Fortino.

### What was this homework about?
This homework explored neural networks. Classifiers (on the MNIST dataset) and autoencoders to perform super-resolution (on human faces).

### What was the <b>hardest</b> part of this homework for you?
Figuring out the architecture, loss function, and activation functions for the autoencoder.

### What was the <b>easiest</b> part of this homework for you?
The MNIST dataset was actually quite easy to do fairly well on (96% accuracy).

### What is one new thing you learned?
I finally understand how loss function and activation functions are chosen, and what they mean. Additionally, I now know what dropout layers do.
