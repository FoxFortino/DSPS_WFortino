# HW 7

### Contributions
Homework was completed entirely by Willow Fortino.

### What was this homework about?
This homewor explored different clustering methods: K-Means, DBSCAN, and aggloomerative clustering. We also explored TSNE and dendrograms.

### What was the <b>hardest</b> part of this homework for you?
Writing the function to calculate the total intracluster variance really stumped me, not sure why.

### What was the <b>easiest</b> part of this homework for you?
Using TSNE was so easy!

### What is one new thing you learned?
TSNE is actually really interesting and easy to use. I know there is a lot more to it, but I didn't know how to do it before and I see it is rather easy.
