# HW 4

### Contributions
Homework was completed entirely by Willow Fortino.

### What was this homework about?
We completed Exercises 1â€”4 in [HoggBoveyLang2017](https://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/research/2010/08/17/straightline.pdf). These problems were centered around the maximum likelihood estimation fitting for a linear model using the classic (unjustified) linear algebra approach. We found that this approach actually minimizes the chi-squared of the model.

### What was the <b>hardest</b> part of this homework for you?
Figuring out how to manipulate the likelihood in Exercise 4 took a lot of thought.

### What was the <b>easiest</b> part of this homework for you?
Writing the model and fit functions were very easy as I have a lot of practice with that sort of thing.

### What is one new think you learned?
That the @ symbol can be used for matrix multiplication in Python, and also this homework really clarified to me what exactly is going on in the linear algebra for a simple linear regression. For example, it's now more clear to me how the chi-squared fits in to data fitting in general.
