# HW 3

### Contributions
Homework was completed entirely by Willow Fortino.

### What was this homework about?
This homework was about reproducing the results of a paper (Corral 2018) which investigated the hypothesis that, during periods of seismic inactivity in a region of California, the time-gaps between earthquakes followed a scaling law. To investigate this we used the two-sample KS-Test.

### What was the <b>hardest</b> part of this homework for you?
Figuring out how I actually make Figure 1 was such a challenge.

### What was the <b>easiest</b> part of this homework for you?
Apart from the pre-procesing we did in class, finding a new way to reduce the pandas dataframe to data from only within the seismic periods was a lot of fun and also potentially the easiest. But that is because the other main part of this homework (the multi-for-loop) was quite difficult too.

### What is one new think you learned?
I had no idea that |= was an operator, but I tried it on a whim and it worked! Booleans are cool.
