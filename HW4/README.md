### Contributions
Homework was completed entirely by Willow Fortino.

### What was this homework about?
This homework was about reproducing the Vera Rubin's work which was fundamental in discovering evidence for dark matter.

### What was the <b>hardest</b> part of this homework for you?
Understanding what exactly we were supposed to take the ratio of and what exactly we were supposed to compare.

### What was the <b>easiest</b> part of this homework for you?
Drawing samples from the uniform distribution and plotting the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis was very straightforward for me.

### What is one new think you learned?
Did not know about sp.stats.skew and sp.stats.kurtosis. Also learned that Vera Rubin's work is surprisingly accessible for undergraduate students to understand.
